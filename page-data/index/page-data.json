I have 5+ years experience running a indie team of developers. and 6+ developing with C# and shaders in Unity. \n    For the last two years I have been doing freelance AR and VR development, building a prototype VR DJ Experience for a startup to generate funding, and research and development of a realtime Global Illumination project for Unity using Compute Shaders.\n    Before that I spent a few years running a bootstrapped virtual reality start-up developing games and software for architects and engineers. I love integrating new technologies and optimizing workflows and have an ability to inspire those around me. I am looking to work\nwith people who want to drive change and alter the digital landscape and make awesome games.","author":"@GerardSlee","github":"https://github.com/ddutchie","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-slee-a6442584/","projects":[{"name":"SuperStar DJ","description":"Building a prototype VR DJing software. - AI crowd simulation and reaction to music, Audio Synthesizers and Mixers and Effects, Role - All Design 3D and Development of the prototype","link":"https://www.superstardj.club/"},{"name":"Lux Walker","description":"LUX WALKER is an interactive PC and VR application that instantly converts your 3D model into a fully immersive 3D true-to-life scale model. - Multiuser (Photon) world building, Runtime 3D Loading, Realtime GI and Occlusion Culling \n Role - Team Lead, User Experience and User Interface, Lighting and Post Effects, All development (mostly C#) since 2017","link":"https://luxwalker.com/"},{"name":"Live Normal","description":"Generate Tileable Texture Maps for your Games and Architectural Renderings - Mobile App, Texture Conversion with HLSL shaders, Google Drive Integration, AWS Data Storage \n Roles - Entire Project, Including : design, development and deployment","link":"https://tenebrislab.github.io/livenormal/"},{"name":"Nigiri Global Illumination","description":"SVO Realtime GI for Unity 3D - SVO Voxel and ScreenSpace GI and Reflection Pipeline.

I love exploring new technologies. I am constantly creating prototypes of ideas and integrating API's in creative ways. My Architecture background means that I have an ability to take concepts through to completed products using a design orientated approach. I am very fluent in gameplay programming with c# , shader and graphics programming, uxdesign as well as management of a team. Being a board member and founder of my start up means I know how to deal with stress and how to translate instructions and progress between all parties involved\n    with a business. I have taken concepts from design phase through deployment on multiple platforms. I am an early adopter of technology and love to explore software development, constantly on the hunt for new tools and Human Interface devices that bridge the gap between design and technology."}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
